# Eduquiz Webpage

## Description

Our goal is to provide a platform where users are able to have fun
while learning a thing or two about the various topics for which
we have quizzes.

Users will be able to keep track of their progress on the user page
through various graphics that will depend upon their performance on
the quizzes they have attempted.
